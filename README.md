# MUMmer & MUMi Python API

## Description:

Simple script to perform multiple pairwise comparisons of > 1 genomes using MUMmer and MUMi.
Works best with shorter genomes (< 5 M bases)

114 ~2.2 M base genomes on intel i7-4790 @3.6 GHz with 8 threads approx. 1 hour to produce 6555
MUMi values

See paper below for information about MUMmer and MUMi:

A genomic distance based on MUM indicates discontinuity between most bacterial species and genera.

## Installation:

Download and install MUMmer from: http://mummer.sourceforge.net/
(requires gcc and make - use something like Cygwin/MinGW if using Windows)

If not already installed, run:

	pip install dill
	pip install numpy

Run:

	./setup.py install


## Usage:

	import mumi
	
	if __name__ == '__main__':
		mumi.mummer = PATH_TO/mummer # if mummer is not on SYS_PATH
		mumi.batch_run(directory='PATH_TO/DIRECTORY', ext='fna', num_threads=4, k=19)
		mumi.single_run('PATH_TO/genome1', 'PATH_TO/genome2', name1='genome1', name2='genome2', k=19)

num_threads = number of cpus to use (only applies to batch_run)

ext = file extension to use within directory e.g. .fna, .fasta, .fas (only applies to batch_run)

k = minimum unique match (MUM) length for mummer. NOTE: k should be > 14 to avoid non-specific MUMs and longer processing time; k = 19 works best for most cases.

name1/name2 = return names (only applies to single_run; names for batch_run are simply input files)

IMPORTANT:

use 

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		...

statement to prevent infinite process spawning!
	
## Bugs & Changes:

Please report any bugs with (preferably) or w/o suggested fixes

## Other Notes:
	
`give_mumi.py` is directly translated from the included Perl script (`give_mumi.pl`) in the mummer 
package, but optimised for speed and efficiency as it is easier to communicate with from the
main script. The result is slightly (but not hugely) different with 3 significant figures of
similarity most of the time. I have much less experience with Perl, so please feel free to point
out any errors in translation.

The `__init__.py`, `multi.py` and `fasta.py` are tools and utils from a larger project and have been 
stripped of some code, but feel free to use what is there for your own endeavours :)
